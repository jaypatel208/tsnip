## ⚙️ How to Integrate Tsnip?

### Prerequisites
You'll need **Nightbot** set up on your channel. If you haven't done this yet, follow this simple guide:  
📹 [How to Setup Nightbot](https://youtu.be/R2f7ZWyiGZw?si=MsdXM0j3pbHmFFsR)

### Integration Steps

1. **Add the Command** - Paste this in your YouTube live chat:

```
!addcom !ts $(urlfetch https://tsnip.vercel.app/api/clip?user=$(user)&chatId=$(chatid)&channelid=$(channelid)&msg=$(querystring)&delay=22)
```

2. **Set User Permissions** (Recommended) - To prevent spam, change the **Required User-Level** to **Moderator** in Nightbot settings.

3. **Customize Delay** - Adjust the `delay=22` parameter based on your stream setup:

| Stream Type | Recommended Delay | Use Case |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Low Latency** | `delay=22` | Real-time interaction |
| **Medium Latency** | `delay=42` | Balanced performance |
| **High Latency** | `delay=58` | Stream sniper protection |

### 📝 How to Create Timestamps

Once integrated, you and your viewers can create timestamps using these commands:

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `!ts` | Creates timestamp with no title | Simple moment capture |
| `!ts Nice Flick Shot` | Creates timestamp with custom title | Titled as "Nice Flick Shot" |

**💬 Confirmation**: After a successful timestamp, you'll see a response from Nightbot confirming the action.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: The delay compensates for the time difference between your live stream and when viewers see it in chat.

## 🎯 How It Works

After your live stream ends, within **2 minutes** our bot will automatically comment with all collected timestamps:
